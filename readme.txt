Privacy-friendly analytics for your WordPress site

== Description ==

Koko Analytics is a privacy-friendly analytics plugin for your WordPress site. It does not need any external services, so the data about your visitors never leaves your site.

Your visitors privacy is respected so that nothing is tracked that could lead back to one specific visitor.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Plugins > New Plugin*, search for **Koko Analytics** and click "*Install now*"
1. Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of `analytics-plugin.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Does this respect my visitor's privacy?
Absolutely, nothing that could lead back to the visitor is recorded. Furthermore, if the visitor has "Do Not Track" enabled in their browser, this is respected.

#### Why are my pageviews not showing up right away?
The plugin uses a buffer file where pageviews are stored for a very short time before they are permanently stored, as this greatly speeds up the tracking process for sites with many visitors. This means that pageviews will only show up in your dashboard after a 1 minute delay.

#### Does this use any external services?
No, the data never leaves your website.
